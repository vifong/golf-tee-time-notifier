## ‚õ≥ GolfNow Tee Time Notifier ‚è∞

This workflow scrapes the [GolfNow website](https://www.golfnow.com/), extracts the open tee times given various parameters (golf courses, # of players, time cutoff, days of the week, etc.), and sends an SMS text message when a new tee time of interest is available.

### üõ†Ô∏è How does it work
The workflow uses the following tools:
* __Selenium__ web driver to spin up a browser and scrape the webpage.
* __GitHub Actions__ to upload/download data snapshots and send __[Twilio SMS notifications](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/twilio-sms)__.
* __Cloudflare__ worker to dispatch the workflow on cron schedule.
  * _Note: [GitHub Actions scheduling isn't very reliable](https://upptime.js.org/blog/2021/01/22/github-actions-schedule-not-working/). See inspiration for the solution [here](https://github.com/upptime/upptime/issues/42#issuecomment-840264035)._

#### üöß Constaints
Currently it's built for our specific use case, but in the future I can abstract the parameter to make the workflow more generalizable:
* Hardcoded 5 golf courses of interest.
* Only scrapes weekends within the next 7 days.
* Filters for tee times between 7:45am and 3pm.
* Filters for at least 2 golfer spots available.
* Only sends a text message if there are new tee times added when comparing to the previous notification.
* Workflow runs every 2 minutes, scheduled via Cloudflare worker.
